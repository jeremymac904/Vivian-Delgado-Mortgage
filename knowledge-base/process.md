# Process Overview

We start with a short intake to understand goals, timeline, and property type.

We review income, assets, and credit, then match the right loan program.

We compare lenders and explain tradeoffs in plain language.

You get a clear plan with next steps, timelines, and expectations.

We coordinate underwriting and keep communication steady through closing.
